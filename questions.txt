### QUESTIONS ###

√ How best to compare competing metrics for a similar ecological variable (e.g., AmbientTemp vs. TempDiff) as predictors in a model set? Include both in the global model?

√ How best to go about fixing convergence warnings. Re-scaling seems to make matters worse.

√ Contrasts on the grouping variable?

Make mention that bout duration doesn't vary over course of incubation period (lm(Mins~NestAge, data = bouts))

Frequency of off-bout initiation as funciton of distance?

HOW to select RE *structures* (not grouping variables, but structures--esp. w.r.t. interactions, etc.)?

### MODEL-FITTING

Setting the 'start' option as the end of the last fit---what if I also change the optimizer?

Ranef-selection model (REML=TRUE) has 'OK' gradient. Switch to ML for fixef selection and gradient spoils.
Compare the following:
convCheckR( dur.ranef_topMod )
convCheckR( dur.fixef_baseMod )

Top random-effects structure includes an interaction (( 1 | fID ) + ( NestAge * TempDiff - 1 | fID )), but that interaction is quick to fall out of the fixed effects during stepwise elimination (second iteration: NestAge:TempDiff p = 0.86895).
